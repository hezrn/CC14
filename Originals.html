                <p>As a spin-off of The Vampire Diaries, The Originals had big shoes to fill, and it absolutely delivered! It’s darker and more intense, focusing on the powerful Mikaelson family. I love how it dives into the history of the vampires and explores themes like family loyalty and betrayal. I love most is how it explores themes of power and family, showing that even the strongest have their weaknesses. The New Orleans setting with all its supernatural vibes just adds even more magic to the show.</p>

                    This Kdrama is such an emotional rollercoaster! From the gripping storyline to the raw intensity of the fight scenes, it had me hooked every step of the way. I really connected with Yeon Si-eun and his journey of standing up against bullies despite the odds. The bond between the characters, their struggles, and the sacrifices they make for one another add so much depth. Itâ€™s a series that keeps you on edge, with moments of suspense, heartbreak, and triumph that stay with you long after watching.</p>
